FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* What went wrong:
A problem was found with the configuration of task ':termux:app:mergeReleaseAssets' (type 'MergeSourceSetFolders').
  - Gradle detected a problem with the following location: '/home/runner/work/flutter_ide/flutter_ide/build/app/intermediates/shader_assets/release/compileReleaseShaders/out'.
    Reason: Task ':termux:app:mergeReleaseAssets' uses this output of task ':app:compileReleaseShaders' without declaring an explicit or implicit dependency. This can lead to incorrect results being produced, depending on what order the tasks are executed.
    Possible solutions:
      1. Declare task ':app:compileReleaseShaders' as an input of ':termux:app:mergeReleaseAssets'.
      2. Declare an explicit dependency on ':app:compileReleaseShaders' from ':termux:app:mergeReleaseAssets' using Task#dependsOn.
      3. Declare an explicit dependency on ':app:compileReleaseShaders' from ':termux:app:mergeReleaseAssets' using Task#mustRunAfter.
    For more information, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.14/userguide/validation_problems.html#implicit_dependency in the Gradle documentation.
* Try:
> Declare task ':app:compileReleaseShaders' as an input of ':termux:app:mergeReleaseAssets'
> Declare an explicit dependency on ':app:compileReleaseShaders' from ':termux:app:mergeReleaseAssets' using Task#dependsOn
> Declare an explicit dependency on ':app:compileReleaseShaders' from ':termux:app:mergeReleaseAssets' using Task#mustRunAfter
> Run with --scan to get full insights.
